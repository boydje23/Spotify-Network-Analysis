we all love music, and in fact 93% of the worlds population listens to music! The primary objective of this project is to examine what network analysis can reveal about cultural and regional music patterns. 
By constructing networks of songs linked through shared artists, we seek to understand how musical collaborations and cross-regional popularity shape the structure of global music charts.

This fun and creative project is derived from the Spotify Top 200 Weekly charts. I used Spotify charts to gather our data from five different regions: Japan, the United States, Nigeria, Denmark, and Brazil. For each region, I collected the top 200 songs from the week of November 6, giving us a total of 1,000 chart entries. It is important to note that this data is strictly from the week of November 6 and nothing more.
Each entry contains data such as the song title, artist name(s), stream counts, chart rank, peak position, and other descriptive fields.

Below is the resaerch conclusins and how I set up the netwrok:
